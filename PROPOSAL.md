####What project you want to do
For my project, I plan on creating a database showcasing data about the CUMTD bus routes. If time allows, I want to use
Cinder to create an app to display the information. I will use SQL to create the initial database, then create a more 
visually pleasing version of the database using Cinder. In the database, I plan on storing all of the bus routes, 
linking them to their corresponding bus stops. I will also include other information, including the days that certain 
routes are running, along with any other data I can find.

####What background knowledge do you have on this kind of project, and why do you want to do this project?
I have worked with SQL before and I really enjoy working with data sets and databases. I'm also familiar with the CUMTD
bus system, so I will feel comfortable with the data and it will be exciting for me to work with. As a statistics major,
I want to get better at working with databases in languages other than R. I think that this will keep me motivated to
finish the project. I think the assignments in which we used JSON and read in data from files gave me a good idea of 
how to approach this project.

####A rough timeline of what will get accomplished and when (e.g, "By the end of Week 2, I will have implemented XYZ and will start working on ABC")
- **End of Week 1:** Gathered data and put in file, created basic database
- **End of Week 2:** Started to implement Cinder
- **End of Week 3:** Completely implemented Cinder to create a visually pleasing database

####If you were to finish the project early, what extra "stretch goals" could you implement?
If I end up finishing the project early, I want to try to use Cinder to create an app showcasing the data. Depending 
on how much time I have, I will either create an app with a basic version of the database or implement more functionality.
This could involve implementing different screens with different categories of data.
