####What project you want to do
For my project, I plan on creating a Cinder app showcasing data about the CUMTD bus routes. I'm going to use maps to store
 all of the bus routes, linking them to their corresponding information. This information will include the different route
  names, information about trips associated with the route, and any other data I can find.

####What background knowledge do you have on this kind of project, and why do you want to do this project?
I really enjoy working with data sets and databases, so I'm interested in familiarizing myself with data structures
 -- in particular, maps. I'm also familiar with the CUMTD bus system, so I will feel comfortable with the data
  and it will be exciting for me to work with. As a statistics major, I want to get better at working with and managing
   data in languages other than R. I think that this will keep me motivated to finish the project. I think the assignments
    in which we used JSON and read in data from files gave me a good idea of how to approach this project.

####A rough timeline of what will get accomplished and when (e.g, "By the end of Week 2, I will have implemented XYZ and will start working on ABC")
- **End of Week 1:** Gathered data and put in file, started creating maps and sorting data
- **End of Week 2:** Started to implement Cinder
- **End of Week 3:** Completely implemented Cinder to create a functioning app

####If you were to finish the project early, what extra "stretch goals" could you implement?
If I end up finishing the project early, I want to implement more user-friendly functionality in my app. This could
include an interactive map with a GPS that shows icons where the bus stops are. I also think the app would be more 
useful if I could implement a search functionality -- for example, the user could search for a certain stop, and the 
results would show all of the bus routes that go to that stop.
