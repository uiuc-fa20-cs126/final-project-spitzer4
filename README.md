The goal of my project was to display information about the CUMTD bus system. The interface of my app
includes a list of routes with clickable buttons and a list of maps with clickable buttons. When the user clicks on a
route button, information about the route is displayed: its ID, long name, short name, color, and trip ID. When the user clicks
on a map button, a PNG image of that map populates on the screen. The route information will automatically clear and update
if the user selects a different route, but the map will not.
